EF is passionate about supporting ambitious, talented people to maximise their impact, and accelerate their lives and career paths. EF was founded on the premise that the world is missing out on some of its best founders. Restricted by lack of resources, time, networks, geography and opportunity, people with the potential to found the most important technology of the future were not. EF's 6-month long programme breaks down those barriers and opens the door to entrepreneurship for the next generation of leading founders.",
