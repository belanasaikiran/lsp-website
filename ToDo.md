### What we do ?

> At LightSpeed Photonics,

     we combine optical interconnects with Processors to build a modular “compute+interconnect” heterogeneous System-in-Package (SiP), “LightSiP™” resulting in a scalable server reducing data latency, footprint, power consumption while increasing the data bandwidth and performance per watt.  It incorporates proprietary high data rate free-space optical interconnect, “LightKonnect™” for protocol agnostic chip-to-chip communication.

    Reconfigurable electronics provides the computing power and optics provides the interconnect and together, the LightSiP provides upto 20x performance at half the power.
